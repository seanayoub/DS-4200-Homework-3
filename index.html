                    Hi! My name is Sean Ayoub, and I am a third-year student at Northeastern University with a combined major 
                    in Data Science and Economics. My passion is music, and I have been playing musical instruments since I was 
                    nine years old. When I began, I first started with the piano, taking lessons with a local teacher. I would 
                    soon start with the band program at my elementary school, where I decided I wanted to play the trumpet. I had 
                    many opportunities to solo, both within the band and with the choir program as well. I stuck with it for several 
                    years, although after some time I began to realize that I wasn't happy playing the trumpet. I thought back to the 
                    reasons I had joined band and started playing instruments in the first place, and always because I wanted to be 
                    playing classical music. I made the decision to leave the trumpet behind, not to quit, but to pursue something more 
                    artistically satisfying. When the Covid-19 pandemic hit as a sophomore in high school, I realized it was the perfect 
                    time to make a change, and I officially picked up the clarinet. After several months practicing during the lockdown, 
                    I had the opportunity to audition for the local youth orchestra and placed in their top orchestra as Principal Clarinet.
