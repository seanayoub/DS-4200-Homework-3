Sean Ayoub - Homework 3 Part 1


The link to the website:


For the styling and customizations that appear on the website, I:
- Changed the default font to Trebuchet MS, as well as the text's font size
	and padding in relation to other elements
- Styled the navigation bar to be a horizontal bar across the top of the page,
	instead of a list (as it renders originally)
- Changed the background of the navigation bar to be a light green color that
	compliments the rest of the page
- Created a container (div) that includes the image and the text description,
	and made it so that both elements will display side-by-side in the same
	row instead of directly on top of each other
