                    As part of my high school band program, we were required to participate in both Concert Band as well as 
                    Marching Band. We spent the two weeks before school started in "Band Camp" learning the drills, steps, and 
                    formations to our half-time show, which was themed every year. We would perform at every football game during 
                    the season which culminated in the big Thanksgiving game towards the end of the year. Besides this, I also 
                    performed in the Jazz Band, an extra ensemble, from my middle school years into the end of my high school 
                    career. After my switch to the clarinet, I auditioned for the regional band and was surprised when I made 
                    it in on my first attempt. Following that, I was eligible to audition for all-state band, which was even 
                    more selective, and made it in only months after I started with the instrument. I further decided to audition 
                    for all-national band. Despite this, symphony orchestra remained my biggest passion. After three years with the 
                    state's youth orchestra, I continued my music career into college at the Northeastern University Symphony Orchestra, 
                    which has allowed me to expand my repertoire. I've also participated in the campus Musical Theatre Co. as a pit musician, 
                    which was a wonderful opportunity. Pictured is the pit musicians at one of the dress rehearsals for the 
                    production of <i>Something Rotten</i>.
